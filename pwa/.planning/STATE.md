## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 10 phases derived from 47 requirements across 8 categories
- [Roadmap]: Phases 6+7 can run in parallel (both depend on Phase 3, independent of each other)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 8+9 can run anytime after Phase 1 (infrastructure-only dependencies)
- [03-01]: Placed new table migrations at end of run_migrations() before final Ok(())
- [03-01]: origin_id defaults to "local" via serde default function

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- racingpoint.cloud domain: verify registered and DNS A records point to 72.60.101.58 before Phase 1
- WhatsApp Business API templates: submit booking confirmation + PIN delivery templates early (Phase 3) for approval before Phase 4
- Admin repo (racingpoint-admin): separate repo needs to be cloned to VPS or built and pushed to registry for Phase 6
