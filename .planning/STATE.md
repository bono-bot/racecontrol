# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** Customers see their lap times, compete on leaderboards, and compare telemetry
**Current focus:** v7.0 E2E Test Suite — Phase 41: Test Foundation (ready to plan)

## Current Position

Phase: 41 of 44 (Test Foundation)
Plan: 2 of 2 (complete)
Status: Phase 41 complete — all 2 plans done, ready for Phase 42
Last activity: 2026-03-19 — Plan 41-02 complete: Playwright + cargo-nextest installed

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 25%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2 (v7.0 milestone)
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 0.17 hours

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 41-01 | 3 min | 2 | 5 |
| 41-02 | 7 min | 2 | 6 |

**Recent Trend:** On track

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

(v7.0 E2E Test Suite — key constraints from research)
- Playwright version locked to 1.58.2 with bundled Chromium — msedge channel has documented 30s hang after headed tests
- `workers: 1` and `fullyParallel: false` are mandatory — game launch tests mutate live pod state and collide if parallelized
- `reuseExistingServer: true` is mandatory — venue kiosk is already running on :3300, Playwright must attach not restart
- data-testid attributes must be added to kiosk source (Phase 42) BEFORE any wizard spec is written (Phase 43)
- Pre-test cleanup fixture must exist BEFORE any stateful test — stale games/billing poison subsequent test runs
- Shell scripts own HTTP API verification; Playwright owns browser layer — never blur this boundary
- `/api/v1/fleet/health` is the correct endpoint for ws_connected checks (NOT `/api/v1/pods`) — confirmed pitfall
- F1 25 Steam launch ID is 3059520 (EA Anti-Cheat bootstrapper), NOT store ID 2805550 — must verify on Pod 8
- Pod 8 is the sole test target — never run launch tests on pods 1–7 (may have live customer sessions)
- run-all.sh is the final integration point — only writable once all phase scripts exist (Phase 44)

(Phase 41-01 — shell test library decisions)
- summary_exit exits with FAIL count only — skips are informational, do not cause failure
- lib/common.sh has NO set options — callers manage their own error handling (smoke.sh needs -e, game-launch.sh does not)
- pod_ip() uses hyphens (pod-1 through pod-8) matching POD_ID variable format — Python dict used underscores and silently failed
- TTY check gates ANSI colors — CI gets clean text, terminals get colors

(Phase 41-02 — Playwright and nextest decisions)
- Playwright 1.58.2 with bundled Chromium — msedge channel has documented 30s hang (GitHub #22776)
- fullyParallel:false and workers:1 are non-negotiable — game launch tests mutate live pod state
- reuseExistingServer:true — venue kiosk already running on :3300, must attach not restart
- baseURL defaults to http://192.168.31.23:3300 — KIOSK_BASE_URL env var overrides for dev/CI
- playwright.config.ts at repo root — auto-discovered by npx playwright test without --config flag
- cargo-nextest per-process isolation is the default — not explicitly configured in nextest.toml
- node_modules/ was missing from root .gitignore — fixed; root node_modules was being tracked in git

### Pending Todos

- Pod 3 still not verified running after fix-pod.bat — needs physical reboot + verification
- Version string inconsistency: USB-installed pods report v0.1.0, HTTP-deployed report v0.5.2
- BIOS AMD-V disabled on Ryzen 7 5800X — v6.0 blocked; must enable SVM Mode before Phase 36

### Blockers/Concerns

- v6.0 (Phases 36–40) is blocked on BIOS AMD-V — Phase 41 may start independently as pure test infrastructure
- Phase 42 gate: data-testid audit of kiosk/src/app/book/ must confirm attributes exist or be added before wizard specs are scoped
- Phase 43 gate: Steam app IDs for EA Anti-Cheat wrapped games require manual verification on Pod 8 before launch specs are written
